## Requirements
Design and implement a facility management system complete with user management, facility maintenace management, and internal faciltiy management. Written in Java

### Project 1: Facility Management System Design and Implementation
Initial design and implementation for the management system.  
Designed with 3 Packages:  
1. facility - The internal members and methods of each Facility and the Facility interface
2. maintenance - The members and methods requried to make maintenance requests and schedule maintenace for each facility
3. use - The members and methods required for making and managing facility usage and users

### Project 2: Object Wiring with Spring Framework

### Project 3: Bridge/Observer Implementation
Bridge Implementation added by abstracting maintenance and use interfaces to the FacilityOperations class.  
FacilityOperations is used by Facility and Client to perform and maintenace or use management methods rather than having to call them separately.
